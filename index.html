They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the Chinese programâ€™s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time.
